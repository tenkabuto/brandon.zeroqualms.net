I suspect that in the world's current, business landscape, if you can execute on a solid vision of how the world's market offerings currently aren't but could be, effectively, --- which I understand is a BIG IF --- you can win big and possibly bigger than just going the efficiency route, which I view as either pushing the existing manners of operating a bit harder than the rest or incrementally improving upon the prevailing ways of doing things and not really diverging from what's already known and developed.
And I suspect that this same suspicion is at the heart of today's startup culture.

I also suspect that the business landscape could/will change. Too many people may move into the entrepreneurial/startup space, raising up too many nice but unyieldingly inefficient structures in search of new markets, more than society will bear. We need a way to measure this if none exists so that we can see and prepare for such a winding down, but until then I would like to explore the dynamics of the entrepreneurial world.

One fascinating aspect of it is the degree to which one's idea (when grand, "vision") for a potential venture is valued. There's some degree of consensus that without execution upon the idea --- the realization of them[^lean] --- it's worth nothing. Nonetheless, some guard their ideas for ventures while others say them loudly, proudly, and, sometimes, incessantly. There is loose debate about whether one should discuss their ideas for ventures with others. In the remainder to this essay I will lay out some strategic consideration that one may want to make prior to discussing their ideas for ventures with others. I assume that any such discussions are not merely idle chatter, or that the person that would divulge their ideas has the intent to execute upon their idea (if they are not already doing so).

[^lean]: In even their most pathetic and rudimentary forms, say, especially, the proponents of the "lean startup" philosophy.

Much discussion of this that I have seen focuses upon the importance of perceiving the degree to which one (person A) is more or less competent or well-suited for the (successful) executing of the idea than the person to whom they would tell it (person B). Some suggest that the competence of the person to whom you would tell your idea (person B) is less relevant than the possibility that they know someone else (person C) who is more competent than you. This, they and I suggest, may be gauged by perceiving whether person B seems like a person who is sufficiently chatty and/or a person that's passionate enough about a domain that your idea addresses, that it's quite likely they may have built up a network of like-interested persons who may be more competent and well-suited to execute upon the idea than person B is, were they to be told the idea by person B.

However, though I do think this is an important thread to follow, I suspect that a lesser-discussed thread should be followed (assuming that it has been openly discussed prior to now).
