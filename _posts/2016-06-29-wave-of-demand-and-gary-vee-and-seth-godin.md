There are currently a few big, public figures that think about business and entrepreneurialism, and of them, Gary Vee and Seth Godin are possibly the most interesting.
Both of them primarily agree about a few things, but they differ in an important way.
Gary harps upon the importance of quantity, while Seth almost too tenderly advances the importance of quality.

They both agree that a societal shift has taken place and
that if you do not know which way it has shifted, you will likely not be able to become successful by doing the same things that people used to be able to do and become successful.
Thankfully, they each offer freely, if not pleadingly, their own solution, their own view of where society has shifted to and how you can become successful.

If you figure out which way it's going, you can respond appropriately and not be obliterated by it and both ride it out and have some fun while doing so.
