title: Innovation as a Process of Caring
---

Much is said these days about "innovation" and "innovations," but I think that "innovation" has been thought about in an incorrect manner.

When we have talked about innovations, we have for a long while been concerned with some particular things. We have said "ah, _that_ [thing] is such an innovation." And sometimes we have admitted that these things are the results of some process, a process that we have come to call "innovation" or "innovating" --- as it results, presumably, in the creation of innovations.

However, I think that this focus upon the result of the process of innovation (or innovating) have caused us to overlook what innovation really is. As a result, I think that we lack an understanding of what enables "innovations" to emerge and why, after a time, they lose their innovativeness.

When we think about innovation, we should think about the process that preceded the result. I suggest that we should see the process of innovation, or innovating, as a process in which people care about something that others either do not care about or do not care enough about.
