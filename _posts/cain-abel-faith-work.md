During the past semester I went through a course entitled *Intro to the Bible*, where I learned and practiced the process of exegesis, [the critical explanation or interpretation of a text](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exegesis), in regards to the Hebrew and Christian bibles (Old and New Testaments). While the class read through Genesis and talked about it, I came to the following interpretation about [Genesis 4][gen4]:2-5, but I was unable to write about it for the class as it was beyond the scope of the class.

I am interested in story contained within [the second sentence of verse two through the first part of verse five][gen4]. The story was presented in the class as one that connects with two intersecting themes in the Hebrew bible: (1) that agriculture is bad/wrong and (2) that the city/urban living is bad/wrong[^ag-urban].

The story is the first of many in the Hebrew bible ("Old Testament") that suggest that agriculture (in the sense of [cultivating the soil for the growing of crops][agriculture]) is bad, but the story doesn't directly address why agriculture is bad. Additionally, the story suggests that pastoralism ([the rearing of animals to provide food, wool, and other products][pastoralism]) is good or more preferable to 

[agriculture]: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/agriculture "Agriculture"
[pastoralism]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism
[gen4]: http://biblehub.com/genesis/4.htm "Genesis 4"
[^ag-urban]: The connection between these is that agriculture enables an urban center to be sustained, and, as one who lives in an urban center is dependent upon others, urban living disconnects one from their dependence upon God -- which is bad/wrong --; thus agriculture is bad/wrong.
