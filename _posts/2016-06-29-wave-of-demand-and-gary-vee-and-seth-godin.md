There are currently a few big, public figures that think about business and entrepreneurialism, and of them, Gary Vee and Seth Godin are possibly the most interesting.
Both of them primarily agree about a few things, but they differ in an important way.
Gary harps upon the importance of quantity, while Seth almost too tenderly advances the importance of quality.

They both agree that a societal shift has taken place and
that if you do not know which way it has shifted, you will likely not be able to become successful by doing the same things that people used to be able to do and become successful.
Thankfully, they each offer freely, if not pleadingly, their own solution, their own view of where society has shifted to and how you can become successful.

I suggest that because economics largely tells us that one is able to succeed, or to make money, by catering to demand,[^notAlways] we should view societies as things that ride (or fail to ride) waves of demand.
Those waves move towards what is demanded.

[^notAlways]: If it costs you more money (marginally) to cater to demand than catering it delivers to you (marginally), you're gonna have a bad time.

Gary and Seth suggest that the current wave of demand is moving towards two different, but possibly overlapping, directions: those of quantity and quality, respectively.
In other words, Gary suggests that quantity is demanded now, possibly more than ever, while Seth suggests that quality is demanded now, possibly more than ever.

They also suggest that, like with waves, if you figure out which direction demand is moving, you can respond appropriately (often by pivoting your thinking or strategy) and be both not-obliterated by it and be able to both ride it out and have some fun while doing so.

I suggest that Gary's advice is quantity-focused because most of it is oriented towards either producing a significant volume of work or producing work that previously was not available.
Both cases consider merely quantity.
It is only when he thinks within the context of a competitive scenario that he publicly suggests using quality as the primary means of catering to demand.

I am concerned that his listeners and followers may be hearing only the first thing and not the second.
I am particularly concerned because Seth suggests nearly the opposite.

Seth starts out by suggesting that our world's market has matured and that it no longer demands what it once did, quantity.
He, like Gary, suggests that one should produce work that previously was not available,
but he implicitly suggests that doing so is merely a symptom or result of producing more quality and focusing more upon quality.
He suggests that much of the spoils will, for as long as this wave of demand continues


Gary's advice might only be relevantly and effectively applied within the realm of social media and inbound (content) marketing.
