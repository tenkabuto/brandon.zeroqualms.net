title: "Societal Wave of Demand, and Gary Vee and Seth Godin's differing views about it"

There are currently a few big, public figures that think about business and entrepreneurialism, and of them, Gary Vee and Seth Godin are possibly the most interesting.
Both of them primarily agree about a few things, but they differ in an important way.
Gary harps upon the importance of quantity, while Seth almost too tenderly advances the importance of quality.

They both agree that a societal shift has taken place and
that if you do not know which way it has shifted, you will likely not be able to become successful by doing the same things that people used to be able to do and become successful.
Thankfully, they each offer freely, if not pleadingly, their own solution, their own view of where society has shifted to and how you can become successful.

I suggest that because economics largely tells us that one is able to succeed, or to make money, by catering to demand, we should view societies as things that ride (or fail to ride) waves of demand.
Accordingly, Gary and Seth are suggesting that these waves of demand are moving towards two different, but possibly overlapping, directions: those of quantity and quality, respectively.
They also suggest that, like with waves, if you figure out which way demand is going, you can respond appropriately (often by pivoting your thinking or strategy) and be both not obliterated by it and able to both ride it out and have some fun while doing so.
